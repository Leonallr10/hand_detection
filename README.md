# handsign_detection


## Introduction

The Hand Sign Detection System is designed to detect and recognize hand signs using a Python-based approach. This documentation provides a brief overview of the system's components, including the data collection process, testing functionality, and the ability to upload new data for real-time detection.

## 1. Data Collection Python File

The data collection process involves a Python script that captures and saves data for training the hand sign detection model. This script utilizes computer vision libraries such as OpenCV to access the webcam or other input devices for capturing images. The collected data typically includes various hand signs from different angles and lighting conditions.

### Usage:

```python
# Example usage of the data collection script
python data_collection.py
```

The collected data is stored in a specified directory for later use in training the hand sign detection model.

## 2. Test Python File

The test Python script is responsible for evaluating the hand sign detection model using the collected data. It loads the pre-trained model and tests its accuracy on a separate set of data. The script can provide detailed results, including accuracy metrics and visualization of the detection outcomes.

### Usage:

```python
# Example usage of the test script
python test.py
```

The test script loads the model, processes the test data, and outputs results indicating the accuracy of the hand sign detection.

## 3. Real-time Detection with Data Upload

In addition to the pre-collected data, the system allows real-time hand sign detection using an option to upload new data. This functionality enables users to input custom data and receive immediate results based on the trained model.

### Usage:

```python
# Example usage of real-time detection with data upload
python real_time_detection.py --upload_data path/to/uploaded_data
```

Users can provide their own data during runtime, and the system will dynamically incorporate it for detection.

## Conclusion

The Hand Sign Detection System provides a flexible and extensible framework for collecting, testing, and deploying hand sign detection models. Users can easily integrate the system into their applications, and the real-time detection with data upload feature allows for continuous improvement and customization based on specific needs.
